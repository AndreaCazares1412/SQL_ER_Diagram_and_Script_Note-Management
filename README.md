## Entity-Relationship Diagram and SQL Script for Text Note Management System

### About
This project includes an Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram and an SQL Script designed for a system that manages text notes. The ER diagram visually represents the structure of the database, showcasing how entities (such as notes, users, etc.) relate to each other. The SQL script implements the database structure, allowing for the management of text notes through basic operations such as creation, update, deletion, and retrieval.
